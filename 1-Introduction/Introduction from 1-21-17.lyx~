 and seems most appropriate.
 Currently there is no consensus on the timing or nature of the crisis,
 and its visible form has evolved through several phases: increased defaults
 and foreclosures in the U.S.
 housing market (2006), liquidity crisis and credit crunch (2007), failure
 and distress of major financial institutions (2007-8), drastic government
 intervention (2007-13), a global recession of epic proportions (2007 -
 2009+), Europe's sovereign debt and austerity imbroglio (2009 - present),
 and Brexit and the rise of right-wing populist movements in Europe and
 the U.S.
 (c.
 2009 - present).

 Because land prices are a major component of housing prices, generally
 believed to reflect capitalized streams of land rent, and the supply of
 land is relatively limited in the short term, land rent is the prime candidate
 for the lion's share of the house-price inflation.

 While

 Instead, the paper is an interpretive description of ongoing changes in

 briefly recounts the history of economic geography since the 1970's.
 In doing so he metaphorically borrows a practice from computer software
 development, calling the prevalent academic practice during the period
 from around 1970 to the mid-1990's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

economic geography 1.0

economic geography 2.0.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 But in computer software such nomenclature typically connotes improvement
 in subsequent generations, in the sense that they correct earlier errors
 (fix bugs) and enhance capabilities.
 But neither characteristic is self-evident in economic geography as practiced
 since the 1990's.
 In fact, a good case can be made that the second phase is retrograde.

 Although no comprehensive study of the methodology underpinning the field's

This may be especially true for younger scholars.
 Studying the structural dynamics of capitalism requires some familiarity
 with mainstream macroeconomics and its heterodox counterpoints, as well
 as enough mathematics both to make one's way through this often math-laden
 literature and to conduct independent research.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 often transitioned later to doing political-economic research on broad
 structural dynamics.
 Even though they rejected the positivism and apologetics of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

spatial science,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 their knowledge of the mainstream literature and their quantitative training

 But after twenty-five years of fragmentation, things have changed.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

generational shift towards more qualitative approaches.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 If so, then younger scholars today may be ill-equipped for studying capitalism'

 Rigor can be a casualty of this proclivity to make small investments combined

On top of this, the field's ventures into such things as poststructuralism
 and postmodernism introduced widely varying standards of what legitimately
 counts as high-quality research.
 In such an environment, what is one person's rigor is another's rigor mortis.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the bigger point is that economic geography today is nowhere near the
 ideal of a scientific community, joined together around the common goal
 of developing a shared understanding of the world by building on a common
 research program, focusing on a consensual set of questions, and finding
 ways to adjudicate disagreements.
 In this context, the likelihood that even a subset of contemporary economic
 geographers would identify potential threats to the global economic order,
 consistently monitor such threats, and based on such research warn about
 the order's immanent implosion is virtually nil.
 Mainstream economics may be autistic ??, but economic geography suffers
 from attention deficit disorder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nonetheless, despite its disorder and fragmentation, certain unifying threads
 run through contemporary economic geography.
 These include the shared beliefs that capitalism is neither universal nor
 superior to other forms of economic organization; that capitalism is necessaril
y subject to crises and generally in a state of disequilibrium; that there
 is no such thing as a separate, self-governing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 but instead 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 aspects of society are always embedded in a wider social web of culture,
 institutions, ecology, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

; that spatiality matters in that space cannot be reduced to a Cartesian
 container but instead is intrinsic to human life, and the social, historical,
 and spatial aspects of human societies constitute and determine each other
 in a socio-spatial dialectic; that society is not an undifferentiated collectio
n of individuals, much less one with common goals and bound together by
 social contracts or other forms of mutual consent, but instead consists
 of social relations of unequal power along various axes of domination/subordina
tion; and that concrete research on actual economies in specific places
 is particularly important.

 heterodox and points to economic geography's pluralism as stronger qualificatio

 But on its own pluralism per se does not qualify a set of practices as
 heterodox, and in fact some authors claim mainstream economics is already
 pluralist and becoming more so.
 See below.

 But these beliefs are very general and therefore leave room for great variation
 in the practice of economic geography, so these threads tying economic
 geography together are quite loose.

Sheppard cites

 But my own reading of Derrida's book is that its title refers to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spectre
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that Marx and Engels described as haunting Europe at the beginning of the
 
\emph on
Communist Manifesto
\emph default
 (i.e., communism), and Derrida's book (which originally was a lecture) is
 about using post-structuralism as a tool to identify something in today's
 world that could serve a similar role as a radical liberation movement.
 In relation to this, Derrida identifies ten 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plagues
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of today's global capitalism.
 But in keeping with this obviously religious allusion, much of Derrida's
 book deals with similar religious and supernatural allusions in Marx.
 To me the most memorable and dramatic of these (and the most relevant to
 this paper) is the image of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

an enchanted, perverted, topsy-turvy world, in which Monsieur le Capital
 and Madame la Terre do their ghost-walking as social characters and at
 the same time directly as mere things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Nonetheless, the practice of describing Derrida as himself being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

haunted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by Marx in that he (Dirrida) had to deal with Marx, and describing other
 authors the same way, perhaps with some deliberate irony, is not uncommon.
 For example, without reference to Derrida, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "walker2004thespectre"

\end_inset

 uses similar imagery specifically with respect to David Harvey's influence
 on geography.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This metaphor is very apropos.
 Many contemporary economic geographers treat not only Marx but the entire
 Marxist tradition more like a corpse than as something living and evolving.
 Hence, in post-1990 economic geography one finds almost zero references
 to new developments within Marxian economics, such as new, non-equilibrium,
 non-dual interpretations of the labor theory of value 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "freeman2010trendsin"

\end_inset

 or the copious literature rethinking Marx's theory of money in relation
 to production 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "graziani2003themonetary,wray1999theories"

\end_inset

; conversely, today very few economic geographers – even, or especially,
 those whose work is very much in a Marxist vein – make much effort to present
 their work as extending or modifying received Marxian political economy.
 Even around 1990, when the then-dominant 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

structuralist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Marxian geographical political economy came under increasing criticism
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "scott07economic"

\end_inset

, few critics sought to reconcile their criticisms with the received approach
 by correcting or augmenting it.
 This was despite the fact that the critics were often sympathetic in that
 they shared with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

structuralists
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the inclination to reject spatial science's technocratic impulse in favor
 of a broader project of human liberation, and their criticisms of the received
 approach often maintained it was incomplete and too restrictive rather
 than incorrect .
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Incomplete by ignoring or downplaying class conflict, gender, human subjectivity
 and agency, non-capitalist elements in existing economies, and so on.
 Of course, an approach that is incomplete very likely will be unable to
 explain empirical situations on its own, and the causal efficacy of what
 it claims to know will depend on what elements it omits.
 So in this sense that structural logic was (mis)applied to certain situations,
 the approach was incorrect.
 Besides this, perhaps the main substantive criticism of the approach per
 se is that it was insufficiently open.

This is not to deny that some economic geographers, most notably David Harvey,
 continue to work in an explicitly Marxist frame, or that ideas from Marxist
