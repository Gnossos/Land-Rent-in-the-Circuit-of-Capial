@book{krugman_geography_1991,
	Abstract = {"I have spent my whole professional life as an international economist thinking and writing about economic geography, without being aware of it," begins Paul Krugman in the readable and anecdotal style that has become a hallmark of his writings. Krugman observes that his own shortcomings in ignoring economic geography have been shared by many professional economists, primarily because of the lack of explanatory models. In Geography and Trade he provides a stimulating synthesis of ideas in the literature and describes new models for implementing a study of economic geography that could change the nature of the field.Economic theory usually assumes away distance. Krugman argues that it is time to put it back - that the location of production in space is a key issue both within and between nations.Paul Krugman is Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has been a consultant to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the United Nations, the Trilateral Commission, and the U.S. State Department. He is a member of the Group of Thirty. His books include the recent bestselling Age of Diminished Expectations: U.S. Economic Policy in the 1990s.},

@article{king_capital_1989,
	Abstract = {The flow of both productive and speculative investment into housing relates to the state of capital accumulation in other economic sectors, as hypothesised in the 'circuits of capital' argument, but it also relates to the incentive to 'switch' investment into and out of housing, and therefore to expectations of ground rent and the (changing) social conditions that enable ground rent extraction. This is the first of three papers in which the relationships involved in these processes are explored. A series of theoretical problems arising from the argument are dealt with, principally relating to its seeming economic determinism and to an inappropriately narrow treatment of crisis and social change. In the subsequent papers, in this journal, these various ideas will be used to reflect on housing market and related social change in Melbourne from the 1930s to the 1980s.},

@article{hall_geographies_2013,
	Abstract = {This report focuses on the intersection between finance and the `real economy'. I begin by examining how political economy approaches to money and the wider financialization literature reveal the entangled relationship between finance and broader economic practices. I then review how recent work in economic geography has used these approaches to develop understandings of the role of financial circuits in everyday economic life and the implications of this for the international financial system. This research is important because it problematizes popular and policy calls to rebalance the economic activity in favour of the `real economy'. I argue that this highlights the need to examine how financial circuits might be produced differently in order to develop a more sustainable financial system and associated economy.},

@article{krugman_new_2011,
	Abstract = {Krugman P. The New Economic Geography, now middle-aged, Regional Studies. This paper claims that the New Economic Geography has now become `middle-aged'. On the one hand, the New Economic Geography is said to be of less relevance when describing current developments in advanced economies because it focuses more on tangible causes of the spatial concentration of economic activities, and not so much on intangible sources, such as information spillovers. On the other hand, the paper states that recent developments in developing economies like China are quite in line with the core--periphery model that predicts increasing regional specialization as a result of economic integration. Although both economists and geographers study these spatial processes, no fruitful exchange between the two is expected because of the use of different methodologies. Krugman P.

In diesem Beitrag wird die These aufgestellt, dass sich die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie inzwischen im mittleren Alter befindet. Einerseits gilt die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie als weniger relevant zur Beschreibung von aktuellen Entwicklungen in den Industriestaaten, weil sie sich st{\"a}rker auf die greifbaren Ursachen der r{\"a}umlichen Konzentration von Wirtschaftsaktivit{\"a}ten und weniger auf nicht greifbare Quellen wie z. B. Informations{\"u}bertragungen konzentriert. Andererseits wird in diesem Beitrag festgestellt, dass die j{\"u}ngsten Entwicklungen in Schwellenl{\"a}ndern wie China durchaus dem Kern-Peripherie-Modell entsprechen, in dem eine h{\"o}here regionale Spezialisierung als Ergebnis einer wirtschaftlichen Integration prognostiziert wird. Obwohl diese r{\"a}umlichen Prozesse sowohl von {\"O}konomen als auch von Geografen untersucht werden, ist aufgrund der Verwendung unterschiedlicher Methodologien kein fruchtbarer Austausch zwischen diesen beiden Gruppen zu erwarten.

@article{krugman_whats_1998,
	Abstract = {Since 1990 a new genre of research, often described as the 'new economic geography', has emerged. It differs from traditional work in economic geography mainly in adopting a modelling strategy that exploits the same technical tricks that have played such a large role in the 'new trade' and 'new growth' theories; these modelling tricks, while they preclude any claims of generality, do allow the construction of models that - unlike most traditional spatial analysis - are fully general-equilibrium and clearly derive aggregate behaviour from individual maximization. The new work is highly suggestive, particularly in indicating how historical accident can shape economic geography, and how gradual changes in underlying parameters can produce discontinuous change in spatial structure. It also serves the important purpose of placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream.},

financial crisis and to have significantly underestimated its dimensions once it started to unfold. In our 
view, this lack of understanding is due to a misallocation of research efforts in economics. We trace 
the deeper roots of this failure to the profession's insistence on constructing models that, by design, 
disregard the key elements driving outcomes in real-world markets. The economics profession has 
failed in communicating the limitations, weaknesses, and even dangers of its preferred models to the 
public. This state of affairs makes clear the need for a major reorientation of focus in the research economists undertake, as well as for the establishment of an ethical code that would ask economists to understand and communicate the limitations and potential misuses of their models.},

This paper is an attempt to understand all the real estate markets, from the most peripheral ones, where the urban rent is the lowest, to the most dense city centres. To gain a better understanding of the real estate market, a process of firstly deconstruction and then reconstruction is used. The process of deconstruction involves identifying various market trends according to property type (principally residential buildings), players and institutions, territorial situations and temporalities based on research conducted in Switzerland. We then developed a meta-synthesis inspired by Fernand Braudel whose works put as much emphasis on day-to-day economic activity as on long-term activity, and on local as well as global issues.},

We show that the rent-price ratio ranged between 5 and 5.5 percent between 1960 and 1995, but rapidly declined after 1995. By year-end 2006, the rent-price ratio reached a historic low of 3.5 percent. For the rent-price ratio to return to its historical average over, say, the next five years, house prices likely would have to fall considerably.},

	Abstract = {Of the components of {GDP}, residential investment offers by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming recession. Since World War {II} we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables.  Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy.  A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylor's output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.},

@article{christophers2011revisiting,
	Abstract = {In a recent interview, David Harvey referred to the initial stages of the ongoing global economic crisis as a ``financial crisis of urbanization.'' This article explores and substantiates Harvey's argument by returning to the thesis of capital switching that Harvey, following Henri Lefebvre, initially expounded in the 1970s and 1980s. The nub of this argument was that as capitalist production edges toward periodic crises of overaccumulation, capital ``switches'' from production per se into production of the urban built environment as a means to absorb surplus capital and hence avert---if only temporarily---crisis. Although Harvey's thesis has proven extremely influential among political economists, urban theorists, and geographers of various stripes, previous attempts to buttress it with empirical evidence have failed to unearth any demonstrable switching dynamic of the kind Harvey theorizes. This article analyzes data for the years leading up to 2007 and the unfolding of the current economic crisis. Focusing primarily on the United Kingdom, it presents two separate analyses that suggest a clear pattern of capital switching into the built environment since the turn of the millennium: first, a switching of overall private-sector expenditures and, second, a switching of pension fund investment. Together, the analyses place urbanization, following Harvey, at the heart of contemporary economic crisis.},

@incollection{trigg2004marxand,
	Abstract = {The theory of the monetary circuit, as developed in its most powerful form by
Graziani (1989), has made a significant contribution to the analysis of credit
money in Marxian economics. A key issue is the extent to which circuit theory
fails to take into account the relationship between sectors producing capital
and consumption goods. In Marx's reproduction schema, how much money do capitalists need to advance in order for exchange between sectors to balance,
and for the circuit to be closed? The purpose of this paper is to address this
issue by examining diffrrent models of the monetary circuit, each of which
has a textual grounding in Marx's often contradictory musings in Capital,
Volume 2. Alongside alternative conceptions of the circuit of money, different interpretations exist about the role of the multiplier which can be nested
in Marx's reproduction schema. The problem, from a Marxian point of
view, is that in the existing literature investment is usually confined to the
capital goods sector It can be argued that Marx, for the most part, viewed
investment as involving accumulation in both departments of production.
Using a multiplier framework, derived from input-output technology, this
wider treatment of investment is considered as an alternative way of
modelling the circulation of money. In addition to contributing to Marxian
analysis of the money circuit, this approach could also be more accessible to a wider Post Keynesian audience, since a scalar Keynesian multiplier is employed.},

	Abstract = {The line of scholarship dominating Anglophone geographers' approaches to studying economic geography since 1980 can be characterized as geographical political economy; an approach prioritizing commodity production over market exchange. Here the spatialities of capitalism co-evolve with its economic processes and economic, political, cultural and biophysical processes are co-implicated with one another. Disequilibrium is normal and space/time an emergent feature. This approach is very different from geographical economics. Mutual engagement is desirable and most easily approached via the geographical sub-field of regional political economy. Regional political economy demonstrates that capitalism's spatialities increase agents' uncertainty and the likelihood of unintended consequences, that microfoundations are inadequate, and that capitalism is generative of economic inequality and uneven geographical development. The scope of geographical political economy is illustrated by the geography of commodity production.},

The  busting  of  the bubble, then, was followed by the crisis. The model is calibrated with reference to quarterly data from the Flow of Funds Accounts, from 1960 to 1995. The interaction of financialization and the housing bubble, from 1996 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2009, is examined by simulating a baseline version of the model and imposing the observed shocks.},

	Abstract = {With the aim of helping to revivify a stalled geographical literature on the place of land in capitalist political economies, this article presents a critique of the popular idea that land can be usefully conceptualised as a `fictitious' form of capital or commodity. The critique is based primarily on a close and critical consideration of the grounds on which the identifiers and theorists of such fictitiousness -- Marx/Harvey in the case of capital, Polanyi in the case of the commodity -- distinguished it from `real' variants. Those grounds, the article argues, are tenuous. And, far from disabling us, treating land as no more or less real than other forms of capital and commodity can empower us in productively revisiting and centring the question of land's political economy -- a crucial undertaking in a world where the materiality of land to social relations is writ increasingly large.},
