@report{Levitin_2012_Explaining,
	Abstract = {There is little consensus as to the cause of the housing bubble that precipitated the financial crisis of 2008. Numerous explanations exist: misguided monetary policy; a global savings surplus; government policies encouraging affordable homeownership; irrational consumer expectations of rising housing prices; inelastic housing supply. None of these explanations, however, is capable of fully explaining the housing bubble.  This Article posits a new explanation for the housing bubble. First, it demonstrates that the bubble was a supply-side phenomenon attributable to an excess of mispriced mortgage finance: mortgage-finance spreads declined and volume increased, even as risk increased \textemdash{} a confluence attributable only to an oversupply of mortgage finance.  Second, it explains the mortgage-finance supply glut as resulting from the failure of markets to price risk correctly due to the complexity, opacity, and heterogeneity of the unregulated private-label mortgage-backed securities (PLS) that began to dominate the market in 2004. The rise of PLS exacerbated informational asymmetries between the financial institutions that intermediate mortgage finance and PLS investors. These intermediation agents exploited informational asymmetries to encourage overinvestment in PLS that boosted the financial intermediaries' volume-based profits and enabled borrowers to bid up housing prices.  This Article proposes the standardization of PLS as an information-forcing device. Reducing the complexity and heterogeneity of PLS would facilitate accurate risk pricing, which is necessary to rebuild a sustainable, stable housing-finance market.},

@inproceedings{Peck_2015_Navigating,
	Abstract = {In both a formal and temperamental sense, contemporary Anglo-American economic geography is a heterodox enterprise. The paper explores distinctive currents in the discipline's theory-culture, both in its own terms and in relation to the wider field of heterodox economics. A methodological intervention is proposed, inspired by the substantivist project of ``comparative economy,'' with the 
goal of prompting a renewed conversation between economic geography's ``lumpers,'' those concerned with the refinement and reconstruction of generalized categories of analysis, and its ``splitters,'' who opt to work against (or outside) such tacitly accepted categories, favoring their 
deconstruction and displacement.  Even if lumpers and splitters are never entirely comfortable in one another's company, they should not be allowed to live apart. Furthermore, their cohabitation is an enduring and positive characteristic of economic geography's heterodox theory-culture, the substantive concerns of which center on the problematic of economic spatiality, its constitution, causality, and consequences.},

@article{Fourcade_2015_Superiority,
	Abstract = {In this essay, we analyze the dominant position of economics within the network of the social sciences in the United States. We begin by documenting the relative insularity of economics, using bibliometric data. Next we analyze the tight management of the field from the top down, which gives economics its characteristic hierarchical structure. Economists also distinguish themselves from other social scientists through their much better material situation (many teach in business schools, have external consulting activities), their more individualist worldviews, and their confidence in their discipline's ability to fix the world's problems. Taken together, these traits constitute what we call the superiority of economists, where economists' objective supremacy is intimately linked with their subjective sense of authority and entitlement. While this superiority has certainly fueled economists' practical involvement and their considerable influence over the economy, it has also exposed them more to conflicts of interests, political critique, even derision.},

@article{Dicken_2004_Geographers,
	Abstract = {Over the years, geographers have developed a disturbing \textendash{} even dysfunctional \textendash{} habit of missing out on important intellectual and politically significant debates, even those in which geographers would seem to have a major role to play. The syndrome of processes currently bundled together within the term `globalization' is intrinsically geographical, as are the outcomes of such processes. Yet, once again, it seems, we are not, as a discipline, centrally involved in what are clearly very `big issues' indeed. The purpose of this paper is to explore, in the context of ongoing globalization debates, the bases of this undesirable situation and to consider what might be done to redress it in ways that could both enhance intra- and interdisciplinarity and also make a contribution towards building a better world.},

@article{Peck_2016_Macroeconomic,
	Abstract = {In dialogue with Ray Hudson's paper on `rising powers' in globalizing capitalism, this review article reflects on the position and priority of these macroscopic questions in the field of economic geography, focusing in particular on the prospects for a reanimated political economy of uneven spatial development. Two themes are explored. First, the paper asks what it means to confront the problematic of rising (and falling) capitalisms, and why it is that the vocabulary for this discussion has to be imported, if not improvised. Second, it explores what it might mean not just to revisit and re(in)state, but to reconstruct notions of uneven spatial development, which despite their virtually uncontestable status in the field of economic geography have in practice often been allowed recede into the explanatory background, either as an implicit ontological precondition or as little more than an ambient sensibility.},

@article{Hall_2013_Geographies,

I begin by examining how political economy approaches to money and the wider financialization literature reveal the entangled relationship between finance and broader economic practices. I then review how recent work in economic geography has used these approaches to develop understandings of the role of financial circuits in everyday economic life and the implications of this for the international financial system. This research is important because it problematizes popular and policy calls to rebalance the economic activity in favour of the `real economy'. I argue that this highlights the need to examine how financial circuits might be produced differently in order to develop a more sustainable financial system and associated economy.},

@book{Coyle_2010_Soulful,
	Abstract = {To many, Thomas Carlyle's put-down of economics as "the dismal science" is as fitting now as it was 150 years ago. But Diane Coyle argues that economics today is more soulful than dismal, a more practical and human science than ever before. Building on the popularity of books such as Freakonomics that have applied economic thinking to the paradoxes of everyday life, The Soulful Science describes the remarkable creative renaissance in how economics is addressing the most fundamental questions--and how it is starting to help solve problems such as poverty and global warming. A lively and entertaining tour of the most exciting new economic thinking about big-picture problems, The Soulful Science uncovers the hidden humanization of economics over the past two decades. Coyle shows how better data, increased computing power, and techniques such as game theory have transformed economic theory and practice in recent years, enabling economists to make huge strides in understanding real human behavior. Using insights from psychology, evolution, and complexity, economists are revolutionizing efforts to solve the world's most serious problems by giving policymakers a new and vastly more accurate picture of human society than ever before. They are also building our capacity to understand how what we do today shapes what the world will look like tomorrow. And the consequences of these developments for human life, for governments, and for businesses are only now starting to be realized--in areas such as resource auctions, pollution-credit trading, and monetary policy. The Soulful Science tells us how economics got its soul back--and how it just might help save the planet's.},

	Abstract = {Economists in the post-Cold War era are increasingly circumspect about universal, one-size-fits-all conceptions of human behaviour and economic institutions. Contemporary economics is thus marked by a nascent pluralism. Economic Pluralism brings these pluralist sensibilities to the fore. Its twenty original essays explore the positive potential and critical limits of pluralism in economic theory, philosophy, institutions, and policies, and education.  These twenty original essays reflect the maturity and breadth of pluralist scholarship in economics today. The first eight chapters (including critical essays by Tony Lawson, Diana Strassmann et al., Frederic Lee, and David Colander) stake out contentious positions on the value of pluralism in economic theory and philosophy. The remaining chapters explore the meaning and consequences of pluralism in economic education, institutions, and policies.   This volume provides a unique "second generation" discussion of pluralism in economics. Its twenty original essays stake out contentious positions on pluralism in economic theory, philosophy, institutions, and policies, and education, reflecting multiple generations and traditions of thought. It is a volume certain to spur wider conversation about the scope and value of economic pluralism for the 21st century. This volume would be of most interest as a supplementary text for graduate or undergraduate courses that include units on heterodox economics or economic philosophy.},

	Abstract = {Krugman P. The New Economic Geography, now middle-aged, Regional Studies. This paper claims that the New Economic Geography has now become `middle-aged'. On the one hand, the New Economic Geography is said to be of less relevance when describing current developments in advanced economies because it focuses more on tangible causes of the spatial concentration of economic activities, and not so much on intangible sources, such as information spillovers. On the other hand, the paper states that recent developments in developing economies like China are quite in line with the core--periphery model that predicts increasing regional specialization as a result of economic integration. Although both economists and geographers study these spatial processes, no fruitful exchange between the two is expected because of the use of different methodologies. Krugman P.

In diesem Beitrag wird die These aufgestellt, dass sich die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie inzwischen im mittleren Alter befindet. Einerseits gilt die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie als weniger relevant zur Beschreibung von aktuellen Entwicklungen in den Industriestaaten, weil sie sich st{\"a}rker auf die greifbaren Ursachen der r{\"a}umlichen Konzentration von Wirtschaftsaktivit{\"a}ten und weniger auf nicht greifbare Quellen wie z. B. Informations{\"u}bertragungen konzentriert. Andererseits wird in diesem Beitrag festgestellt, dass die j{\"u}ngsten Entwicklungen in Schwellenl{\"a}ndern wie China durchaus dem Kern-Peripherie-Modell entsprechen, in dem eine h{\"o}here regionale Spezialisierung als Ergebnis einer wirtschaftlichen Integration prognostiziert wird. Obwohl diese r{\"a}umlichen Prozesse sowohl von {\"O}konomen als auch von Geografen untersucht werden, ist aufgrund der Verwendung unterschiedlicher Methodologien kein fruchtbarer Austausch zwischen diesen beiden Gruppen zu erwarten.

@article{krugman_whats_1998,
	Abstract = {Since 1990 a new genre of research, often described as the 'new economic geography', has emerged. It differs from traditional work in economic geography mainly in adopting a modelling strategy that exploits the same technical tricks that have played such a large role in the 'new trade' and 'new growth' theories; these modelling tricks, while they preclude any claims of generality, do allow the construction of models that - unlike most traditional spatial analysis - are fully general-equilibrium and clearly derive aggregate behaviour from individual maximization. The new work is highly suggestive, particularly in indicating how historical accident can shape economic geography, and how gradual changes in underlying parameters can produce discontinuous change in spatial structure. It also serves the important purpose of placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream.},

financial crisis and to have significantly underestimated its dimensions once it started to unfold. In our 
view, this lack of understanding is due to a misallocation of research efforts in economics. We trace 
the deeper roots of this failure to the profession's insistence on constructing models that, by design, 
disregard the key elements driving outcomes in real-world markets. The economics profession has 
failed in communicating the limitations, weaknesses, and even dangers of its preferred models to the 
public. This state of affairs makes clear the need for a major reorientation of focus in the research economists undertake, as well as for the establishment of an ethical code that would ask economists to understand and communicate the limitations and potential misuses of their models.},

This paper is an attempt to understand all the real estate markets, from the most peripheral ones, where the urban rent is the lowest, to the most dense city centres. To gain a better understanding of the real estate market, a process of firstly deconstruction and then reconstruction is used. The process of deconstruction involves identifying various market trends according to property type (principally residential buildings), players and institutions, territorial situations and temporalities based on research conducted in Switzerland. We then developed a meta-synthesis inspired by Fernand Braudel whose works put as much emphasis on day-to-day economic activity as on long-term activity, and on local as well as global issues.},

@article{leamer2007housing,
	Abstract = {Of the components of {GDP}, residential investment offers by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming recession. Since World War {II} we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables.  Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy.  A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylor's output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.},

This article describes the role of financial firms in encouraging that growth and some of its consequences.

In doing so, this article seeks to bring attention to homebuilders as a missing feature in analyses of housing supply and housing markets, and proposes directions for future research.},

@article{christophers2011revisiting,
	Abstract = {In a recent interview, David Harvey referred to the initial stages of the ongoing global economic crisis as a ``financial crisis of urbanization.'' This article explores and substantiates Harvey's argument by returning to the thesis of capital switching that Harvey, following Henri Lefebvre, initially expounded in the 1970s and 1980s. The nub of this argument was that as capitalist production edges toward periodic crises of overaccumulation, capital ``switches'' from production per se into production of the urban built environment as a means to absorb surplus capital and hence avert---if only temporarily---crisis. Although Harvey's thesis has proven extremely influential among political economists, urban theorists, and geographers of various stripes, previous attempts to buttress it with empirical evidence have failed to unearth any demonstrable switching dynamic of the kind Harvey theorizes. This article analyzes data for the years leading up to 2007 and the unfolding of the current economic crisis. Focusing primarily on the United Kingdom, it presents two separate analyses that suggest a clear pattern of capital switching into the built environment since the turn of the millennium: first, a switching of overall private-sector expenditures and, second, a switching of pension fund investment. Together, the analyses place urbanization, following Harvey, at the heart of contemporary economic crisis.},

@incollection{trigg2004marxand,
	Abstract = {The theory of the monetary circuit, as developed in its most powerful form by
Graziani (1989), has made a significant contribution to the analysis of credit
money in Marxian economics. A key issue is the extent to which circuit theory
fails to take into account the relationship between sectors producing capital
and consumption goods. In Marx's reproduction schema, how much money do capitalists need to advance in order for exchange between sectors to balance,
and for the circuit to be closed? The purpose of this paper is to address this
issue by examining diffrrent models of the monetary circuit, each of which
has a textual grounding in Marx's often contradictory musings in Capital,
Volume 2. Alongside alternative conceptions of the circuit of money, different interpretations exist about the role of the multiplier which can be nested
in Marx's reproduction schema. The problem, from a Marxian point of
view, is that in the existing literature investment is usually confined to the
capital goods sector It can be argued that Marx, for the most part, viewed
investment as involving accumulation in both departments of production.
Using a multiplier framework, derived from input-output technology, this
wider treatment of investment is considered as an alternative way of
modelling the circulation of money. In addition to contributing to Marxian
analysis of the money circuit, this approach could also be more accessible to a wider Post Keynesian audience, since a scalar Keynesian multiplier is employed.},

	Abstract = {The line of scholarship dominating Anglophone geographers' approaches to studying economic geography since 1980 can be characterized as geographical political economy; an approach prioritizing commodity production over market exchange. Here the spatialities of capitalism co-evolve with its economic processes and economic, political, cultural and biophysical processes are co-implicated with one another. Disequilibrium is normal and space/time an emergent feature. This approach is very different from geographical economics. Mutual engagement is desirable and most easily approached via the geographical sub-field of regional political economy. Regional political economy demonstrates that capitalism's spatialities increase agents' uncertainty and the likelihood of unintended consequences, that microfoundations are inadequate, and that capitalism is generative of economic inequality and uneven geographical development. The scope of geographical political economy is illustrated by the geography of commodity production.},

It   is   maintained   that   the  contractionary   effects   of   financialization   were compensated  by  the  housing  bubble,  from  the  mid-1990s  to  the  early  2006.  The  busting  of  the bubble, then, was followed by the crisis. The model is calibrated with reference to quarterly data from the Flow of Funds Accounts, from 1960 to 1995. The interaction of financialization and the housing bubble, from 1996 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2009, is examined by simulating a baseline version of the model and imposing the observed shocks.},

	Abstract = {With the aim of helping to revivify a stalled geographical literature on the place of land in capitalist political economies, this article presents a critique of the popular idea that land can be usefully conceptualised as a `fictitious' form of capital or commodity. The critique is based primarily on a close and critical consideration of the grounds on which the identifiers and theorists of such fictitiousness -- Marx/Harvey in the case of capital, Polanyi in the case of the commodity -- distinguished it from `real' variants. Those grounds, the article argues, are tenuous. And, far from disabling us, treating land as no more or less real than other forms of capital and commodity can empower us in productively revisiting and centring the question of land's political economy -- a crucial undertaking in a world where the materiality of land to social relations is writ increasingly large.},

The paper contrasts what might be called a `classical' category with a `modern' category and then analyses treatments of {HE} as a category. It is argued that though {HE} appears to be a complex object -- and that authors recognise this -- {HE} as a category is most often classical even though modern would appear more appropriate. That this is the case may reflect choices of levels of abstraction which in turn reflect instrumental purposes of influencing the reality of Economics. While arguments for the rejection of {HE} as a category are too strong, current treatments of {HE} are perhaps not careful enough in recognising its provisional and fluid nature.

It presents a case that the current economic crisis is a particular type of crisis of over-investment, called an asset bubble induced over-investment crisis. It explains what is meant by that type of crisis and presents empirical evidence for the period since 1979 that supports this interpretation of the crisis.

@report{levitin2012explaining,
	Abstract = {There is little consensus as to the cause of the housing bubble that precipitated the financial crisis of 2008. Numerous explanations exist: misguided monetary policy; a global savings surplus; government policies encouraging affordable homeownership; irrational consumer expectations of rising housing prices; inelastic housing supply. None of these explanations, however, is capable of fully explaining the housing bubble.  This Article posits a new explanation for the housing bubble. First, it demonstrates that the bubble was a supply-side phenomenon attributable to an excess of mispriced mortgage finance: mortgage-finance spreads declined and volume increased, even as risk increased --- a confluence attributable only to an oversupply of mortgage finance.  Second, it explains the mortgage-finance supply glut as resulting from the failure of markets to price risk correctly due to the complexity, opacity, and heterogeneity of the unregulated private-label mortgage-backed securities ({PLS}) that began to dominate the market in 2004. The rise of {PLS} exacerbated informational asymmetries between the financial institutions that intermediate mortgage finance and {PLS} investors. These intermediation agents exploited informational asymmetries to encourage overinvestment in {PLS} that boosted the financial intermediaries' volume-based profits and enabled borrowers to bid up housing prices.  This Article proposes the standardization of {PLS} as an information-forcing device. Reducing the complexity and heterogeneity of {PLS} would facilitate accurate risk pricing, which is necessary to rebuild a sustainable, stable housing-finance market.},

@article{elden2010landterrain,
	Abstract = {This paper outlines a way toward conceptual and historical clarity around the question of territory. The aim is not to define territory, in the sense of a single meaning; but rather to indicate the issues at stake in grasping how it has been understood in different historical and geographical contexts. It does so first by critically interrogating work on territoriality, suggesting that neither the biological nor the social uses of this term are particularly profitable ways to approach the historically more specific category of `territory'. Instead, ideas of `land' and `terrain' are examined, suggesting that these political-economic and political-strategic relations are essential to understanding `territory', yet ultimately insufficient. Territory needs to be understood in terms of its relation to space, itself a calculative category that is dependent on the existence of a range of techniques. Ultimately this requires rethinking unproblematic definitions of territory as a `bounded space' or the state as a `bordered power container', because both presuppose the two things that should be most interrogated, space and boundaries. Rather than boundaries being the distinction between place and space, or land or terrain and territory, boundaries are a second-order problem founded upon a particular sense of calculation and concomitant grasp of space. Territory then can be understood as a political technology: it comprises techniques for measuring land and controlling terrain, and measure and control --- the technical and the legal --- must be thought alongside the economic and strategic.},

The syndrome of processes currently bundled together within the term `globalization' is intrinsically geographical, as are the outcomes of such processes. Yet, once again, it seems, we are not, as a discipline, centrally involved in what are clearly very `big issues' indeed. The purpose of this paper is to explore, in the context of ongoing globalization debates, the bases of this undesirable situation and to consider what might be done to redress it in ways that could both enhance intra- and interdisciplinarity and also make a contribution towards building a better world.},

Economies are represented realistically in a fully articulated system of national income and flow of funds accounts.

Starting with extremely simple stock-flow consistent models, the text describes a succession of increasingly complex models constructed with such rigor that, in harmony with its basis in accounting, there is always one equation which is implied logically by all the others. Readers will be able to download all the models and explore their properties for themselves.},

@book{foley1986understanding,
	Abstract = {Understanding Capital is a brilliantly lucid introduction to Marxist economic theory. Duncan Foley builds an understanding of the theory systematically, from first principles through the definition of central concepts to the development of important applications. All of the topics in the three volumes of Capital are included, providing the reader with a complete view of Marxist economics.   Foley begins with a helpful discussion of philosophical problems readers often encounter in tackling Marx, including questions of epistemology, explanation, prediction, determinism, and dialectics. In an original extension of theory, he develops the often neglected concept of the circuit of capital to analyze Marx's theory of the reproduction of capital. He also takes up central problems in the capitalist economy: equalization of the rates of profit (the "transformation problem"); productive and unproductive labor and the division of surplus value; and the falling rate of profit. He concludes with a discussion of the theory of capitalist crisis and of the relation of Marx's critique of capitalism to his conception of socialism.   Through a careful treatment of the theory of money in relation to the labor theory of value, Foley clarifies the relation of prices to value and of Marx's categories of analysis to conventional business and national income accounts, enabling readers to use Marx's theory as a tool for the analysis of practical problems. The text is closely keyed throughout to the relevant chapters in Capital and includes suggestions for further reading on the topics discussed.},

Its twenty original essays explore the positive potential and critical limits of pluralism in economic theory, philosophy, institutions, and policies, and education.  These twenty original essays reflect the maturity and breadth of pluralist scholarship in economics today. The first eight chapters (including critical essays by Tony Lawson, Diana Strassmann et al., Frederic Lee, and David Colander) stake out contentious positions on the value of pluralism in economic theory and philosophy. The remaining chapters explore the meaning and consequences of pluralism in economic education, institutions, and policies.   This volume provides a unique "second generation" discussion of pluralism in economics. Its twenty original essays stake out contentious positions on pluralism in economic theory, philosophy, institutions, and policies, and education, reflecting multiple generations and traditions of thought. It is a volume certain to spur wider conversation about the scope and value of economic pluralism for the 21st century. This volume would be of most interest as a supplementary text for graduate or undergraduate courses that include units on heterodox economics or economic philosophy.},

@article{delanghe2010howmonist,
	Abstract = {Some heterodox economists, most notably Tony Lawson, have come under suspicion of not being true pluralists, but  strategic pluralists': their advocacy of pluralism is thought to be merely instrumental to a hidden monist agenda. This paper does not aim to judge the accused but rather to assess the accusations; the focus is on clarifying the notion of pluralism itself. First a paradox is found to lie at the core of scientific pluralism. Different responses to this paradox can be traced to different views on pluralism found in the literature. The resulting classification allows an analysis of the current controversy among pluralists and provides an understanding of the different aspects of the debate.},

@article{mearman2011pluralism,
	Abstract = {The paper addresses the arguments made by Frederic Lee on heterodoxy and pluralism. It argues that the definitions of mainstream and heterodox, and consequently the differences between them, are highly problematic. Specifically it challenges Lee's characterizations of mainstream and heterodox economics as noncomparable. Attempts to contrast them starkly are part of a rhetoric of distinction which may be problematic. Thus, Lee's concept of intellectual pluralism may be weaker than it seems, because it is based on distinction and its tolerance, rather than an embrace of diversity. Further, both theoretical and intellectual pluralism may be based on wider epistemological and ontological grounds and thus Lee's distinction between them may also be problematic. Sheila Dow's structured pluralism may be a more productive way of embracing difference.

Two themes are explored. First, the paper asks what it means to confront the problematic of rising (and falling) capitalisms, and why it is that the vocabulary for this discussion has to be imported, if not improvised. Second, it explores what it might mean not just to revisit and re(in)state, but to reconstruct notions of uneven spatial development, which despite their virtually uncontestable status in the field of economic geography have in practice often been allowed recede into the explanatory background, either as an implicit ontological precondition or as little more than an ambient sensibility.},

@article{wyly2009cartographies,
	Abstract = {The worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression has drawn   worldwide attention to America's subprime mortgage sector and its   linkages with predatory exploitation in working-class and racially   marginalized communities. During nearly two decades of expansion, agents   of subprime capital fought regulation and reform by (1) using the   doctrine of risk-based pricing to equate financial innovation with   democratized access to capital, (2) appealing to the cultural myths of   the 'American Dream' of homeownership, and (3) dismissing   well-documented cases of racial discrimination and predatory abuse as   anecdotal evidence of rare problems confined to a few lost-cause places   in what is otherwise a benevolent free-market landscape. In this   article, we challenge these three tactics. Properly adapted and updated,   Harvey's (1974) theory of class-monopoly rent allows us to map and   interpret the localized, neighborhood exploitations of class and race in   several hundred {US} metropolitan areas as they were woven through Wall   Street securitization conduits into global networks of debt and   investment. Understanding the structural inequalities of class-monopoly   rent is essential for analysis, organizing, and policy responses to the   crisis.},

@article{immergluck2011thelocal,
	Abstract = {The {US} subprime crisis beginning in 2007 was largely the result of an increasingly direct connection between global capital markets and {US} homeowners and neighborhoods, with little mediation, oversight or restraint, especially on the part of the public sector. There was little concern as to the consequences that high-risk lending might have on local communities and their residents. Rather, the focus was on promoting liquidity at all costs, in order to increase transaction volumes (and associated profits) and promote the short-term economic growth that came with greater financialization. As part of their deregulatory agenda, federal policymakers pre-empted states' attempts to regulate subprime lending, despite the fact that a key outcome of the crisis --- the accumulation and concentration of vacant foreclosed properties --- hit many local communities hard. After summarizing the key origins of the crisis, including the role of federal policymakers in supporting subprime lenders and pre-empting state lending regulations, I describe the piling up of vacant foreclosed properties in many neighborhoods. Foreclosed properties can pose many difficulties for communities, especially those already suffering from other economic and structural disadvantages. I also discuss the primary federal response to the problem of vacant foreclosed properties, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which was adopted in the summer of 2008.},

@article{hudson2016risingpowers,
	Abstract = {The emergence of the rising powers has been seen as heralding a fundamental shift in global economic geography. It can also be seen as the latest expression of capitalist economic development. I first consider theorizations of this development as combined, uneven and crisis-prone, with an ongoing tension between processes of differentiation and equalization. I then situate the rising powers in the context of successive patterns of global uneven development, the transformation from an Old to a New International Division of Labour and then to a `new' New International Division of Labour in which the emergence of the rising powers is a major element. There are, however, significant differences among the rising powers in their economic development trajectories, in the role of the state in shaping these, and in their relationships to other economies in both global North and South. Changes at the global scale are linked to changes in the intra-national geographies of economies in the new global economic geography. I conclude with some speculative remarks as to the possible future trajectories of the rising powers and how global economic geographies might evolve in future.},

Rigorous and accessible, the authors demystify and enliven a crucial subject for geographical study. Underpinned by the themes of globalisation, uneven development and place, the text explores the diversity and vitality of contemporary economic geography. It balances coverage of 'traditional' areas such as regional development and labour markets with insight into new and evolving topics like neoliberalism, consumption, creativity and alternative economic practices. An Introduction to Economic Geography is an essential textbook for undergraduate students taking courses in Economic Geography, Globalisation Studies and more broadly in Human Geography. It will also be of key interest to anyone in Planning, Business and Management Studies and Economics.},

	shorttitle = {Economic Geography},
	abstract = {The turbulence of the current times has dramatically transformed the world’s economic geographies. The scale and scope of such changes require urgent attention. With intellectual roots dating to the nineteenth century, economic geography has traditionally sought to examine the spatial distributions of economic activity and the principles that account for them. More recently, the field has turned its attention to a range of questions relating to: globalization and its impact on different peoples and places; economic inequalities at different geographic scales; the development of the knowledge-based economy; and the relationship between economy and environment. Now, more than ever, the changing fortunes of peoples and places demands our attention.  Economic Geography provides a stimulating and innovative introduction to economic geography by establishing the substantive concerns of economic geographers, the methods deployed to study them, the key concepts and theories that animate the field, and the major issues generating debate. This book is the first to address the diverse approaches to economic geography as well as the constantly shifting economic geographies on the ground. It encompasses traditional approaches, albeit from a critical perspective, while providing a thorough, accessible and engaging examination of the concerns, methods and approaches of the ‘new economic geography’. This unique introductory text covers the breadth of economic geography while engaging with a range of contemporary debates at the cutting-edge of the field.  Written in an accessible and lucid style, this book offers a thorough and systematic introductory survey. It is enhanced by pedagogical features throughout including case studies dealing with topics ranging from the head office locations of the Fortune 500, Mexico’s maquiladoras to China’s investments in Southern Africa. This book also contains exercises based on the key concepts and annotated further reading and websites.},
