 remarkably little to either our understanding of the macroeconomics of

\begin_layout Abstract
Most previous work on ground rent focuses on the mechanisms and institutions
 through which rent is extracted, but this paper takes ground rent as given
 and focuses on its macroeconomics.
 The paper first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

clears the air
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 by discussing heterodox economics and geographical political economy, methodolo
gy, value, and ground rent.
 It then develops several exploratory, abductive simulation models, incrementall
y incorporating different heterodox economic elements and forms of ground
 rent.
 The models build on Marx's circuit of capital but add post-Keynesian and
 institutionalist features, and they employ twenty-first century innovations,
 such as Foley's

 The goal is to develop a better understanding of the macroeconomics of
 ground rent that can inform research and policy in both heterodox economics
 and geographical political economy.

 and seems most appropriate.
 Currently there is no consensus on the timing or nature of the crisis,
 and its visible form has evolved through several phases: increased defaults
 and foreclosures in the U.S.
 housing market (2006), liquidity crisis and credit crunch (2007), failure
 and distress of major financial institutions (2007-8), drastic government
 intervention (2007-13), a global recession of epic proportions (2007 -
 2009+), Europe's sovereign debt and austerity imbroglio (2009 - present),
 and Brexit and the rise of right-wing populist movements in Europe and
 the U.S.
 (c.

 Since land prices are a major component of housing prices, generally believed
 to reflect capitalized streams of ground rent, and, because land is much
 less easily produced than house structures, the prime candidate for the
 lion's share of house-price inflation is ground rent.

 While

 In doing so he metaphorically borrows a practice from computer software

economic geography 2.0.

 But in computer software such nomenclature typically connotes improvement
 in subsequent generations, in the sense that the latter correct earlier
 errors (fix bugs) and enhance capabilities.
 But neither characteristic is self-evident in economic geography as practiced
 since the 1990's.
 In fact, a good case can be made that the later phase is retrograde.

 Finally, much as the flexible specialization literature asserts firms are
 reluctant to make major capital investments in a turbulent economic environment
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, in the turbulent environment of economic geography scholarship, researchers
 are prone to choose topics requiring smaller, less risky investments.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This may be especially true for younger scholars.
 Studying the structural dynamics of capitalism requires some familiarity
 with mainstream macroeconomics and its heterodox counterpoints, as well
 as enough mathematics both to make one's way through this often math-laden
 literature and to conduct independent research.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "490"
key "scott07economic"

 notes that scholars trained during economic geography's quantitative phase
 often transitioned later to doing political-economic research on broad
 structural dynamics.
 Even though they rejected the positivism and apologetics of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spatial science,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 their knowledge of the mainstream literature and their quantitative training
 served them well for this task.
 But after twenty-five years of fragmentation, things have changed.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "119"
key "peck2012economic"

\end_inset

 suggests economic geography has experienced a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generational shift towards more qualitative approaches.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If so, then younger scholars today may be ill-equipped for studying capitalism'
s macro structural dynamics and choose to confine themselves to topics amenable
 to qualitative research at micro and meso levels..
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Even so, in the rush to join the latest fad, rigor can become a casualty,
 and often the quality of this research leaves much to be desired

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
On top of this, the field's ventures into such things as poststructuralism
 and postmodernism introduced widely varying standards of what legitimately
 counts as high-quality research.
 In such an environment, what is rigor to one person' is rigor mortis to
 another.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 But the bigger point is that economic geography today is nowhere near the
 ideal of a scientific community, joined together around the common goal
 of developing a shared understanding of the world by building on a common
 research program and finding ways to adjudicate disagreements.
 The likelihood that even a subset of contemporary economic geographers
 would identify potential threats to the global economic order, consistently
 monitor such threats, and based on such research warn about the order's
 immanent implosion is virtually nil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nonetheless, despite its disorder and fragmentation, certain unifying threads
 run through contemporary economic geography.
 These include the shared beliefs that capitalism is neither universal nor
 superior to other forms of economic organization; that capitalism is necessaril
y subject to crises and generally in a state of disequilibrium; that there
 is no such thing as a separate, self-governing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

economy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but instead 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

economic

 aspects of society are always embedded in a wider social web of culture,
 institutions, ecology, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; that spatiality matters in that space cannot be reduced to a Cartesian
 container but instead is intrinsic to human life, and the social, historical,
 and spatial aspects of human societies constitute and determine each other
 in a socio-spatial dialectic; that society is not an undifferentiated collectio
n of individuals, much less one with common goals and bound together by
 social contracts or other forms of mutual consent, but instead it consists
 of social relations of unequal power along various axes of domination/subordina
tion; and that concrete research on actual economies in specific places
 is particularly important.

 But on its own pluralism per se does not qualify a set of practices as
 heterodox, and in fact some authors claim mainstream economics is already
 pluralist and becoming more so.
 See below.

 But these beliefs are very general and therefore leave room for great variation
 in the practice of economic geography, so these threads tying economic
 geography together are quite loose.

A possibly stronger thread is Marxism.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Sheppard cites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 as the source of this term.
 But my own reading is that the title of Derrida's book refers to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spectre
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that Marx and Engels described as haunting Europe at the beginning of the
 
\emph on
Communist Manifesto
\emph default
 (i.e., communism), and Derrida's book (which originally was a lecture) is
 about using post-structuralism as a tool to identify something in today's
 world that could serve a similar role as a radical liberation movement.
 In relation to this, Derrida identifies ten 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plagues
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of today's global capitalism.
 But in keeping with the obvious religious allusion, much of Derrida's book
 deals with similar religious and supernatural allusions in Marx.
 To me the most memorable and dramatic of these (and the most relevant to
 this paper) is the image of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

an enchanted, perverted, topsy-turvy world, in which Monsieur le Capital
 and Madame la Terre do their ghost-walking as social characters and at
 the same time directly as mere things
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Nonetheless, the practice describing Derrida as himself being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

haunted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by Marx in that he (Dirrida) had to deal with Marx, and describing other
 authors the same way, perhaps with some deliberate irony, is not uncommon.
 For example, without reference to Dirrida, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "walker2004thespectre"

\end_inset

 uses similar imagery specifically with respect to Harvey's influence on
 geography.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This metaphor is very apropos.
 Many contemporary economic geographers treat not only Marx but the entire
 Marxist tradition more like a corpse than as something living and evolving.
 Hence, in post-1990 economic geography one finds almost zero references
 to new developments within even the relatively circumscribed field of Marxian
 economics, such as new, non-equilibrium, non-dual interpretations of the
 labor theory of value 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "freeman2010trendsin"

\end_inset

 or the copious literature rethinking Marx's theory of money in relation
 to production 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "graziani2003themonetary,wray1999theories"

\end_inset

; conversely, today very few economic geographers – even, or especially,
 those whose work is very much in a Marxist vein – make much effort to present
 their work as extending or modifying received Marxian political economy.
 Even around 1990, when the then-dominant 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

structuralist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Marxian geographical political economy came under increasing criticism
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "scott07economic"

\end_inset

, few critics sought to reconcile their criticisms with the received approach
 by correcting or augmenting it.
 This was despite the fact that the critics were often sympathetic in that
 they shared with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

structuralists
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the inclination to reject spatial science's technocratic impulse in favor
 of a broader project of human liberation, and their criticisms of the received
 approach often maintained it was incomplete and too restrictive rather
 than incorrect .
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Incomplete by ignoring or downplaying class conflict, gender, human subjectivity
 and agency, non-capitalist elements in existing economies, and so on.
 Of course, an approach that is incomplete very likely will be unable to
 explain empirical situations on its own, and the causal efficacy of what
 it claims to know will depend on elements the approach omits.
 So in the sense that the structural logic was (mis)applied to certain situation
s, the approach was incorrect.
 Besides this, perhaps the main substantive criticism of the approach per
 se is that it was insufficiently open.

 The former includes payments for the use of not only land but also of buildings
 and other improvements associated with any particular parcel of land.
 Ground rent, on the other hand, consists of payments for the use of land
 net of payments for the use of fixed capital on the land.
 Generally, a parcel of land's location is reflected in payments for its
 use, but the portion of the payment attributable to the parcel's location
 are treated as due solely to the location of the land and therefore are
 as ground rent.
 Since the literature emphasizes location, the literature on rent is primarily

 But in the late eighties critics increasingly attacked the latter approach.
 Significantly, these critics were usually sympathetic in that they shared
 political economy's inclination to reject spatial sciences technocratic
 impulse in favor of a broader project of human liberation, and their criticisms
 generally maintained the approach was incomplete and too restrictive rather
 than incorrect.

Incomplete by ignoring or downplaying class conflict, gender, human subjectivity
 and agency, non-capitalist elements in existing economies, and so on.
 Of course, an approach that is incomplete very likely will be unable to
 explain empirical situations on its own, and the causal efficacy of what
 it claims to know will depend on elements the approach omits.
 So in the sense that the structural logic was (mis)applied to certain situation
s, the approach was incorrect.
 Besides this, perhaps the main substantive criticism of the approach per
 se is that it was insufficiently open.
