In the passage above, Marx identifies important changes in the London's
 housing-construction system during the first half of the nineteenth century.
 With his typically astute powers of observation, he highlights characteristics
 of the nascent system that today are familiar and in many countries have
 become dominant and defining features in the production of the built environmen
t, not only in housing construction but also in construction for commercial
 and other uses as well.

Even more significant, this passage is the 
\emph on

 where Marx gives land-rent a distinctive role in the circulation of capital.
 As the volume's subtitle suggests, it is about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the process of circulation of capital.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If land-rent is absent, this would imply that Marx deemed it largely tangential
 to the circulation of capital.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, elsewhere in the volume, Marx either treats land-rent as incidental
 or he explicitly rejects its relevance because it is only part of total
 surplus value.
 Thus, he uses land-rent as an example of the kind of fixed, short-term
 obligations that capitalists in industries with unavoidably long working
 periods, such as seasonal agriculture, must devise ways to cover while
 awaiting sale of their products 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

(p.

 When he considers how capitalists realize surplus value in the form of
 a greater sum of money than what they originally advanced, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "marx1967capital"

\end_inset

 (pp.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\SpecialChar ldots
 there are only two points of departure: the capitalist and the 
\lang british
labourer
\lang american
.
 All third categories of persons must either receive money for their services
 from these two classes or, to the extent that they receive it without any
 services in return, they are joint owners of the surplus-value in the form
 of rent, interest, etc.
 That the surplus value does not all stay in the pocket of the industrial
 capitalist but must be shared by him with other persons, has nothing to
 do with the present question.
 The question is how he turns his surplus-value into money, not how the
 proceeds are later divided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 19 reviews previous work of others and makes frequent reference
 to land-rent.
 But most such references are either quotations from the original sources
 or Marx's own comments about the sources in which he uses the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ground-rent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as it is used in the original quotation.
 He criticizes these sources, and his criticisms often maintain that ground-rent
 is a distraction when considering the circulation of capital, sometimes
 even merging it with the profit of industrial capital.
 For example, when discussing Adam Smith's treatment of circulating capital
 Marx notes that the circulating value has three parts: value of means of
 production, value of labor-power, and a portion that is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

source of 
\emph on

The Working Period
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the time capital is tied up during a commodity's production (Chapter 12).
 Immediately before the passage, Marx makes the points that, other things
 being equal, longer working periods tie up more capital, as do production
 processes involving larger capital investments.
 Therefore, production of such things is not done capitalistically (i.e.,
 for profit by sale in the market) until capitalism is sufficiently developed,
 with capital highly concentrated in large firms and a mature credit system
 in place.
 To support this, he then uses house-building as an example.
 To be competitive, builders must be large-scale and build speculatively.
 Even so, the profit is insufficient to justify the capitalist builder's
 investment unless the credit system allows the capitalist to externalize
 risk and 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The passage from Marx quoted above describes an important change in the
 system for creating the built environment under capitalism.
 In the early nineteenth century, house-building was small scale; builders
 primarily worked directly for home buyers; those who could afford to purchase
 houses paid for the house in installments, and the payments came from their
 saved revenue; buyers owned the land before building began, and builders
 started building only if they already had a buyer; and the builder's profit
 came mainly from constructing the building itself.
 By as industrial capitalism changed, so too did the system.
 Increasingly, building was done on a large scale; builders speculated and
 built houses for market; financing was through credit; and the main source
 of profit became appreciated land rent, rather than profit on building
 the house itself.
 Also, Marx's comment about risking other people's capital implies that
 leverage was also becoming common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The features of this new system are recognizable today, but with a scale
 and complexity that might shock even Marx.
 The U.S.
 is perhaps the best example of this system's extensive logic.

 large corporate builders increasingly dominate the U.S.

In late eighteenth-century Britain, land-rent still had feudal vestiges.
 Market forces were beginning to penetrate the realm of land ownership and
 rent, but Britain's landed aristocracy still owned the preponderance of
 land and collected rent from tenant farmers.

, justly famous for its pioneering work on land rent, mainly deals with
 agrarian land rent.
 But, as the passage above from Marx attests, by the mid-eighteenth century
 this had changed, and an urban land nexus involving land rent, credit,
 speculative investment, and concentration of capital was taking shape.

Urban land nexus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here refers to a varying set of social, economic, political, and institutional
 relations combined in particular places and times and that together create
 a particular dynamic of urbanization and construction, destruction, and
 use of the built environment.
 This dynamic, in turn, both affects and is affected by the larger set of
 relations that constitute what is commonly called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

macroeconomy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and, more generally, the social formation of which the urban land nexus
 is part.
 Allen Scott, I believe, first used the term in his book,

.
 Interestingly, this seminal book largely ignores many things Marx mentions:
 concentration of capital, credit, finance, money, and speculation; none
 of these terms even appear in the book's index.
 The book also treats the urban land nexus as a rather fixed and universal
 feature of capitalism.
 Compared to this, my usage is more fluid in the sense that the urban land
 nexus differs over space and time within varieties of capitalism; my usage
 also sees money, monetary systems, finance capital, the role of speculation,
 etc.
 as intrinsic elements of the urban land nexus.
 In this sense, my usage comes close to what

 experiencing price increases over 80%, while prices actually declined in
 other areas.
 Neither suddenly increased demand – from growth in population or income
 – nor suddenly constricted supply – due to resource constraints or increased
 construction costs – accounted for the breathtaking price increase.
 Instead, a staggering increase in debt accounted for the increase in house
 prices, the lion's share of which was reflected in increased land prices.
