	Abstract = {Current macroeconomics ignores the roles that rent, debt and the financial sector play in shaping our economy. We discuss the Classical view on rents and policy responses to the rentier sector in the 19th century. The finance, insurance \& real estate sector is today's incarnation of the rentier sector. This paper shows how financial flows can be conceptually and statistically studied separately from (but interacting with) the real sector. We discuss finance's interaction with government and with the international economy.},

@report{colander2009thefinancial,
	Abstract = {The economics profession appears to have been unaware of the long build-up to the current worldwide 
financial crisis and to have significantly underestimated its dimensions once it started to unfold. In our 
view, this lack of understanding is due to a misallocation of research efforts in economics. We trace 
the deeper roots of this failure to the profession's insistence on constructing models that, by design, 
disregard the key elements driving outcomes in real-world markets. The economics profession has 
failed in communicating the limitations, weaknesses, and even dangers of its preferred models to the 
public. This state of affairs makes clear the need for a major reorientation of focus in the research economists undertake, as well as for the establishment of an ethical code that would ask economists to understand and communicate the limitations and potential misuses of their models.},

	Abstract = {Revealing the parties, the processes and the institutions and, consequently, both the diversity and contingency of the real estate markets, the existing increasing literature emphasises the contemporary numerous links and interdependencies between real estate, land value, planning and town planning policy and even the financial system. This paper is an attempt to understand all the real estate markets, from the most peripheral ones, where the urban rent is the lowest, to the most dense city centres. To gain a better understanding of the real estate market, a process of firstly deconstruction and then reconstruction is used. The process of deconstruction involves identifying various market trends according to property type (principally residential buildings), players and institutions, territorial situations and temporalities based on research conducted in Switzerland. We then developed a meta-synthesis inspired by Fernand Braudel whose works put as much emphasis on day-to-day economic activity as on long-term activity, and on local as well as global issues.},

By year-end 2006, the rent-price ratio reached a historic low of 3.5 percent.

@article{leamer2007housing,
	Abstract = {Of the components of {GDP}, residential investment offers by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming recession. Since World War {II} we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables.  Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy.  A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylor's output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.},

@article{christophers2011revisiting,
	Abstract = {In a recent interview, David Harvey referred to the initial stages of the ongoing global economic crisis as a ``financial crisis of urbanization.'' This article explores and substantiates Harvey's argument by returning to the thesis of capital switching that Harvey, following Henri Lefebvre, initially expounded in the 1970s and 1980s. The nub of this argument was that as capitalist production edges toward periodic crises of overaccumulation, capital ``switches'' from production per se into production of the urban built environment as a means to absorb surplus capital and hence avert---if only temporarily---crisis. Although Harvey's thesis has proven extremely influential among political economists, urban theorists, and geographers of various stripes, previous attempts to buttress it with empirical evidence have failed to unearth any demonstrable switching dynamic of the kind Harvey theorizes. This article analyzes data for the years leading up to 2007 and the unfolding of the current economic crisis. Focusing primarily on the United Kingdom, it presents two separate analyses that suggest a clear pattern of capital switching into the built environment since the turn of the millennium: first, a switching of overall private-sector expenditures and, second, a switching of pension fund investment. Together, the analyses place urbanization, following Harvey, at the heart of contemporary economic crisis.},

@incollection{trigg2004marxand,
	Abstract = {The theory of the monetary circuit, as developed in its most powerful form by
Graziani (1989), has made a significant contribution to the analysis of credit
money in Marxian economics. A key issue is the extent to which circuit theory
fails to take into account the relationship between sectors producing capital
and consumption goods. In Marx's reproduction schema, how much money do capitalists need to advance in order for exchange between sectors to balance,
and for the circuit to be closed? The purpose of this paper is to address this
issue by examining diffrrent models of the monetary circuit, each of which
has a textual grounding in Marx's often contradictory musings in Capital,
Volume 2. Alongside alternative conceptions of the circuit of money, different interpretations exist about the role of the multiplier which can be nested
in Marx's reproduction schema. The problem, from a Marxian point of
view, is that in the existing literature investment is usually confined to the
capital goods sector It can be argued that Marx, for the most part, viewed
investment as involving accumulation in both departments of production.
Using a multiplier framework, derived from input-output technology, this
wider treatment of investment is considered as an alternative way of
modelling the circulation of money. In addition to contributing to Marxian
analysis of the money circuit, this approach could also be more accessible to a wider Post Keynesian audience, since a scalar Keynesian multiplier is employed.},

	Abstract = {The line of scholarship dominating Anglophone geographers' approaches to studying economic geography since 1980 can be characterized as geographical political economy; an approach prioritizing commodity production over market exchange. Here the spatialities of capitalism co-evolve with its economic processes and economic, political, cultural and biophysical processes are co-implicated with one another. Disequilibrium is normal and space/time an emergent feature. This approach is very different from geographical economics. Mutual engagement is desirable and most easily approached via the geographical sub-field of regional political economy. Regional political economy demonstrates that capitalism's spatialities increase agents' uncertainty and the likelihood of unintended consequences, that microfoundations are inadequate, and that capitalism is generative of economic inequality and uneven geographical development. The scope of geographical political economy is illustrated by the geography of commodity production.},
